# Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamical Systems (SINDy)[]

In this section, we teach, create, simulate, and visualize SINDy model implemented in NGC-Learn library. 







The model **code** for this exhibit can be found [here](https://github.com/NACLab/ngc-learn/sindy/sindy.py).

## SINDy 
SINDy is a data-driven algorithm that discovers the differential equation governing the dynamical systems. It uses symbolic regression to identify differential equation of the system and it solves sparse regression over the pre-defined library of candidate terms. It takes time series gathered dataset of the system and it gives you its describing differential equation.




SINDy describes the derivative (linear operation acting on â–³t) as linear transformations
of a manually constructed dictionary from the state vector by a coefficient matrix.
Dictionary learning combined with LASSO (L1-norm) promotes the sparsity of the coefficient matrix
which allows only governing terms in the dictionary stay non-zero.
