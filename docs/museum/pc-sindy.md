# Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamical Systems with Predictive Coding (PC-SINDy)

In this section, we teach, create, simulate, and visualize SINDy model with Predictive Coding (PC-SINDy) using NGC-Learn library components.







The model **code** for this exhibit can be found [here](https://github.com/NACLab/pc_sindy.py).


## Predictive Coding (PC)
PC is a biological plausible learning algorithm that learns the effective representation and transformations from the data. 


## Sparse Identification of Non-linear Dynamical Systems (SINDy)
SINDy is a data-driven algorithm that finds the derivative of dynamical systems in terms of a symbolic equation of the system's state vector. 
SINDy describes the derivative (linear operation acting on â–³t) as linear transformations
of a manually constructed dictionary from the state vector by a coefficient matrix.
Dictionary learning combined with LASSO (L1-norm) promotes the sparsity of the coefficient matrix
which allows only governing terms in the dictionary stay non-zero.
